            <p>
                My name is Tee and I'm a student at Kettering University. I was born and grew up in Ann Arbor, MI, and graduated high school in 2014.
                I went to Milwakuee School of Engineering (MSOE), majoring in Mechanical Engineering. After one year there, I found out that software
                is much more my thing than hardware. I transferred here and switched my major to Computer Science, which is where I am since!

                Since I'm a transfer student with >40 credits, I only need 4 work terms to graduate. I worked all 4 terms at Bosch, with my first term
                being a tester in their Car Multimedia department and the other three terms as a software engineering intern in their Chassis Systems
                Control department. I really enjoyed my time there, but now I'm working towards my thesis full time during my next 2 work terms.

            <p>
                I'm not much of a picture taker, buth here are two pictures!<br />
                <img src="kohchang.jpg" alt="Koh Chang in Thailand"  style="width: 20%; height: 20%; float: right;"> <!--use inline style ionstead to comply w validation -->
                I took this picture during our family trip to Koh Chang in Thailand in December 2015. It's right before sunset, but after walking for 45 minutes
                unfortunately the sun was hiding behind the clouds when we arrived :(
                Koh Chang is part of a group of islands off the east coast of Thailand.
                It is near the Cambodian border, and during the 60s and 70s many refugees escaped through this route.
            </p>
            <p> We left from Bangkok, stayed in a hotel in Chantaburi, and stopped
                by a waterfall called "Namtok Phlio." It's part of a national park and there weren't many people when we went. Overall a very fun trip!
            </p>

                  <figcaption>Teddy was our dog from 2006-2015. We adopted him December 30, 2006, when he was 3 months old. He is a golden retriever/chow chow mix.
                      He loved to play but he loved to eat even more. He passed away December 22, 2015 due to cancer. Rest in peace!</figcaption>
